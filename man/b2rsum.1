.SH NAME
b2rsum \- compute and check BLAKE2 message digest recursively

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B b2rsum
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]... [\fI\,FILE or DIRECTORY\/\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B b2rsum
is a bash script to print or check BLAKE2 checksums recursively. It's a 
.BR b2sum (1)
wrapper that adds the capability of processing an entire directory, so the sums are made using it.

When FILE or DIRECTORY is empty or a dot (.), compute current directory. When FILE is -, read standard input.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-binary\fR
read in binary mode
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
read BLAKE2 sums from the FILEs and check them
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-length\fR
digest length in bits; must not exceed the maximum for
the blake2 algorithm and must be a multiple of 8
.TP
\fB\-\-tag\fR
create a BSD\-style checksum
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-text\fR
read in text mode (default)
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR
output to a file named BLAKE2SUMS in the
current directory instead of standard output
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
quiet mode: don't print messages, only hashes; during
check mode, don't print OK for each successfully
verified file
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-status\fR
very quiet mode: output only hashes, no messages; status
code shows success
.SS "The following three options are useful only when verifying checksums:"
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-missing\fR
don't fail or report status for missing files
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
exit non\-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-warn\fR
warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this text and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-license\fR
show license and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show version information and exit
.PP
The sums are computed as described in RFC 7693.  When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a
line with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary,
\&' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.
